# CNN Architecture Comparison for Image Classification

This repository presents a comprehensive exploration of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures applied to a multi-class image classification task. The project compares 9+ models using various activation functions, regularization techniques, optimizers, and loss functions to evaluate their performance based on accuracy, F1 score, and training time.

## üöÄ Final Result
The best-performing model, **Improved Model 3**, achieved:
- **Validation Accuracy:** 75.33%
- **Validation F1 Score:** 74.88%
- **Training Time:** 38.22 minutes
- **Trainable Parameters:** ~2.82 million
